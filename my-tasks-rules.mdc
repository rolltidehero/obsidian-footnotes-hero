# Obsidian Footnote Backreference Synchronization Plugin â€“ Detailed Development Checklist (With Checkboxes)

## 1. Planning & Requirements

- [x] Define the problem and solution
  - [x] Identify user pain points with mismatched backreferences.
  - [x] Specify support for numeric and custom footnote labels (e.g., `[^1]`, `[^video]`, `[^source]`).
  - [x] Draft feature list: dynamic syncing, real-time updates, style options.
- [x] Research technical constraints
  - [x] Review Obsidian plugin API and Markdown rendering.
  - [x] Assess feasibility for parsing and DOM changes.
- [x] Write user stories and success criteria
  - [x] Example: User sees `[^video]` echoed at the footnote backreference.

## 2. Environment & Project Setup

- [x] Install prerequisites (Node.js, npm, code editor, Git)
- [x] Create a dedicated test vault in Obsidian
- [x] Scaffold the plugin using the sample template
- [x] Configure TypeScript/npm scripts
- [x] Enable hot-reload/build process for development

## 3. Core Plugin Architecture

- [x] Create the main TypeScript/JavaScript plugin class
  - [x] Implement `onload` and `unload` lifecycle hooks
  - [x] Register event handlers for note changes and UI updates

## 4. Footnote Parsing Logic

- [x] Extract all inline footnote references (e.g., `[^label]`, `[^1]`)
- [x] Parse all footnote definitions at the bottom of the note
- [x] Map each inline reference to its definition
- [x] Handle duplicates, orphans, and incorrect labels
- [ ] **NEW: Extend parsing to support custom footnote labels**
  - [ ] Update regex patterns to handle non-numeric labels (`[^video]`, `[^source]`, etc.)
  - [ ] Modify auto-incrementing logic to work with custom labels
  - [ ] Add validation for custom label formats
- [ ] Write unit tests for parsing correctness

## 5. DOM Manipulation & Display Synchronization

- [ ] **NEW: Implement the core backreference synchronization feature**
  - [ ] Locate `.footnote-backref` nodes in the rendered view
  - [ ] Replace default backreference icons with actual reference label (`[^1]`, `[^video]`, etc.)
  - [ ] Ensure backreferences remain clickable
  - [ ] Support live DOM updates on document changes
  - [ ] Handle both numeric and custom footnote labels
  - [ ] Add fallback for when custom labels can't be displayed

## 6. Real-Time Synchronization & Event Handling

- [ ] **NEW: Add real-time synchronization for backreferences**
  - [ ] Listen for file edit, save, and Obsidian workspace events
  - [ ] Debounce frequent updates to minimize performance impact
  - [ ] Automatically re-run parsing and DOM synchronization after changes
  - [ ] Test dynamic updating during rapid typing and large edits
  - [ ] Handle edge cases like deleted footnotes, reordered footnotes

## 7. User Preferences & Settings Panel (Optional)

- [ ] **NEW: Create plugin settings tab in Obsidian**
  - [ ] Let users select display style: brackets, emoji, superscript
  - [ ] Preferences for label vs. number prioritization
  - [ ] Toggle for enabling/disabling custom label display
  - [ ] Option to show both label and number
- [ ] Persist settings between sessions

## 8. Testing & Quality Assurance

- [ ] **NEW: Comprehensive testing for backreference feature**
  - [ ] Write and run automated tests for all core logic
  - [ ] Manually test against notes with:
    - [ ] Numeric only, custom only, and mixed footnotes
    - [ ] Duplicate, orphan, and missing cases
    - [ ] Custom labels with special characters
    - [ ] Multi-line footnote definitions
  - [ ] Validate performance on large/complex notes
  - [ ] Test with existing footnote navigation features
  - [ ] Collect and address beta tester feedback

## 9. Documentation & Release

- [ ] **NEW: Update documentation for backreference feature**
  - [ ] Write user documentation and setup instructions
  - [ ] Include annotated screenshots/examples showing before/after
  - [ ] Document custom label support and limitations
  - [ ] Prepare the plugin package (manifest and code)
  - [ ] Submit to the Obsidian Community Plugins list or provide install guide
  - [ ] Include changelog and issue reporting instructions

## 10. Maintenance & Support

- [ ] Monitor and respond to community feedback and bug reports
- [ ] Update plugin for new Obsidian API versions
- [ ] Enhance features based on user needs
- [ ] Keep documentation and changelog current

## 11. **NEW: Integration with Existing Features**

- [ ] **NEW: Ensure compatibility with existing footnote navigation**
  - [ ] Test that backreference synchronization works with existing jump features
  - [ ] Verify custom labels work with navigation between references and definitions
  - [ ] Update navigation logic to handle custom labels properly
  - [ ] Add support for jumping to custom label footnotes

## 12. **NEW: Advanced Features (Future Enhancements)**

- [ ] **NEW: Smart label suggestions**
  - [ ] Auto-suggest labels based on content context
  - [ ] Label templates for common use cases (video, source, quote, etc.)
- [ ] **NEW: Label management**
  - [ ] Bulk rename labels across documents
  - [ ] Label consistency checking
  - [ ] Export/import label schemes
- [ ] **NEW: Enhanced display options**
  - [ ] Custom CSS styling for different label types
  - [ ] Icon integration for specific label categories
  - [ ] Tooltip previews for footnote content

This detailed checklist with checkboxes ensures that each step in developing your plugin will be organized, traceable, and easy to follow during project execution.
