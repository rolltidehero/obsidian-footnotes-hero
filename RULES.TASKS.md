# Obsidian Footnote Backreference Synchronization Plugin â€“ Detailed Development Checklist (With Checkboxes)

## 1. Planning & Requirements

- [ ] Define the problem and solution
  - [ ] Identify user pain points with mismatched backreferences.
  - [ ] Specify support for numeric and custom footnote labels (e.g., ``, `[video]`, `[source]`).
  - [ ] Draft feature list: dynamic syncing, real-time updates, style options.
- [ ] Research technical constraints
  - [ ] Review Obsidian plugin API and Markdown rendering.
  - [ ] Assess feasibility for parsing and DOM changes.
- [ ] Write user stories and success criteria
  - [ ] Example: User sees `[video]` echoed at the footnote backreference.

## 2. Environment & Project Setup

- [ ] Install prerequisites (Node.js, npm, code editor, Git)
- [ ] Create a dedicated test vault in Obsidian
- [ ] Scaffold the plugin using the sample template
- [ ] Configure TypeScript/nmp scripts
- [ ] Enable hot-reload/build process for development

## 3. Core Plugin Architecture

- [ ] Create the main TypeScript/JavaScript plugin class
  - [ ] Implement `onload` and `unload` lifecycle hooks
  - [ ] Register event handlers for note changes and UI updates

## 4. Footnote Parsing Logic

- [ ] Extract all inline footnote references (e.g., `[^label]`, ``)
- [ ] Parse all footnote definitions at the bottom of the note
- [ ] Map each inline reference to its definition
- [ ] Handle duplicates, orphans, and incorrect labels
- [ ] Write unit tests for parsing correctness

## 5. DOM Manipulation & Display Synchronization

- [ ] Locate `.footnote-backref` nodes in the rendered view
- [ ] Replace default backreference icons with actual reference label (``, `[video]`, etc.)
- [ ] Ensure backreferences remain clickable
- [ ] Support live DOM updates on document changes

## 6. Real-Time Synchronization & Event Handling

- [ ] Listen for file edit, save, and Obsidian workspace events
- [ ] Debounce frequent updates to minimize performance impact
- [ ] Automatically re-run parsing and DOM synchronization after changes
- [ ] Test dynamic updating during rapid typing and large edits

## 7. User Preferences & Settings Panel (Optional)

- [ ] Create plugin settings tab in Obsidian
  - [ ] Let users select display style: brackets, emoji, superscript
  - [ ] Preferences for label vs. number prioritization
- [ ] Persist settings between sessions

## 8. Testing & Quality Assurance

- [ ] Write and run automated tests for all core logic
- [ ] Manually test against notes with:
  - [ ] Numeric only, custom only, and mixed footnotes
  - [ ] Duplicate, orphan, and missing cases
- [ ] Validate performance on large/complex notes
- [ ] Collect and address beta tester feedback

## 9. Documentation & Release

- [ ] Write user documentation and setup instructions
  - [ ] Include annotated screenshots/examples
- [ ] Prepare the plugin package (manifest and code)
- [ ] Submit to the Obsidian Community Plugins list or provide install guide
- [ ] Include changelog and issue reporting instructions

## 10. Maintenance & Support

- [ ] Monitor and respond to community feedback and bug reports
- [ ] Update plugin for new Obsidian API versions
- [ ] Enhance features based on user needs
- [ ] Keep documentation and changelog current

This detailed checklist with checkboxes ensures that each step in developing your plugin will be organized, traceable, and easy to follow during project execution.
